## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunghunkwag/NeuroResearch-AI.git
cd NeuroResearch-AI
pip install -e .
```

### Using pip (when published)

```bash
pip install neuroresearch-ai
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from neuroresearch_ai import NeuroResearchAI, ResearchContext, ResearchDomain, ResearchTemplates

# Create research context using template
context = ResearchTemplates.create_ai_research_template("my_research_project")
context.research_question = "How can transformer attention mechanisms be improved for long sequence processing?"

# Initialize the research system
api_keys = {
    "openai": "your-openai-key",
    "anthropic": "your-anthropic-key", 
    "google": "your-google-key"
}

research_system = NeuroResearchAI(
    project_dir="./my_research",
    research_context=context,
    api_keys=api_keys,
    enable_meta_learning=True,
    enable_cross_domain=True,
    enable_ethics_guardian=True
)

# Conduct research
results = await research_system.conduct_research(
    research_question="How can transformer attention mechanisms be improved for long sequence processing?",
    methodology_preferences={"experimental_validation": True, "theoretical_analysis": True},
    quality_threshold=0.85
)

# Generate comprehensive research report
report = research_system.generate_research_report(results)
print(report)
```

### Advanced Usage with Custom Configuration

```python
from neuroresearch_ai import ResearchContext, ResearchDomain

# Create custom research context
custom_context = ResearchContext(
    project_id="advanced_ai_research",
    domain=ResearchDomain.AI_ML,
    research_question="",
    methodology_constraints={
        "requires_large_scale_experiments": True,
        "computational_budget": "very_high",
        "requires_human_evaluation": True
    },
    ethical_considerations=[
        "AI safety and alignment",
        "Potential dual-use concerns",
        "Environmental impact assessment"
    ],
    target_impact_factor=8.5,
    cross_domain_relevance={
        ResearchDomain.NEUROSCIENCE: 0.7,
        ResearchDomain.PSYCHOLOGY: 0.5,
        ResearchDomain.COMPUTER_SCIENCE: 0.9
    }
)

# Advanced research execution
research_system = NeuroResearchAI(
    project_dir="./advanced_research",
    research_context=custom_context,
    api_keys=api_keys,
    enable_meta_learning=True,
    enable_cross_domain=True,
    enable_ethics_guardian=True
)

# Run research with custom parameters
results = await research_system.conduct_research(
    research_question="Can we develop AGI-safe transformer architectures using neuroscience-inspired attention mechanisms?",
    methodology_preferences={
        "multi_modal_evaluation": True,
        "cross_domain_validation": True,
        "safety_testing": True
